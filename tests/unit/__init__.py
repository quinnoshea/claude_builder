dependencies and fast execution times.

Test organization by development phase:
- phase1_core/: Core functionality (analyzer, generator, CLI, config)
- phase2_intelligence/: Intelligence layer (agents, templates, detection)
- phase3_advanced/: Advanced features (template ecosystem, config management, git)
- utils/: Utility functions and helper classes
