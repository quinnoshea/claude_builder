"""
Integration tests for claude-builder.

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly:
- CLI integration with core components
- Template workflows and generation pipelines
- Agent coordination and communication
- Git workflow integration
- Multi-component interaction scenarios

These tests use real components but may mock external dependencies
like network calls or file system operations where appropriate.
