uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
# OR: pip install claude-builder

# Verify installation
claude-builder --help
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate complete development environment for any project
claude-builder /path/to/your/project

# Preview what would be generated (safe mode)
claude-builder /path/to/project --dry-run --verbose

# Generate with agent team optimization

## üåü Real-World Transformations

### Python FastAPI Project
**Before:** Manual setup, generic agent coordination, trial-and-error workflows
```bash
# Traditional approach
- Research which agents might help with API development
- Manually create AGENTS.md with generic agent lists
- Remember agent names: "Use backend-architect for API design"
- Coordinate agents manually: "First security-auditor, then api-tester"
```

**After:** Automatic expert environment with natural triggers
```bash
claude-builder ./my-fastapi-project
# Automatically detects: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis
# Generates intelligent team: backend-architect, api-tester, database-tuner, security-auditor
# Natural language triggers: "optimize database queries", "secure API endpoints", "test performance"
```

### React Dashboard Project
**Before:** Individual agent discovery, manual coordination overhead
```bash
# Traditional approach
- Look up frontend-specific agents
- Manually coordinate ui-designer with frontend-developer
- Remember which agents work well together for React projects
```

**After:** Seamless team orchestration with contextual intelligence
```bash
claude-builder ./react-dashboard
# Detects: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
# Team: frontend-developer, ui-designer, performance-optimizer, accessibility-checker
# Triggers: "optimize bundle size", "improve accessibility", "design better UX"
```

### Rust CLI Tool
**Before:** Generic guidance, no systems-specific optimization
```bash
# Traditional approach
- Use general-purpose agents not optimized for systems programming
- Miss Rust-specific performance and memory management expertise
- No integration with Rust ecosystem tools and patterns
```

**After:** Systems programming expertise with Rust specialization
```bash
claude-builder ./rust-cli-tool
# Detects: Rust, CLI patterns, system dependencies, performance requirements
# Team: systems-programmer, performance-optimizer, cli-specialist, rust-expert
# Triggers: "optimize memory usage", "improve CLI ergonomics", "add benchmarks"
```

---

## üí° Natural Language Interaction Examples

### Feature Development Workflows
```yaml
# Generated automatically for each project
feature_development:
  trigger: "build new feature"
  team: [rapid-prototyper, ui-designer, test-writer-fixer, deployment-manager]
  coordination: sequential_with_feedback

authentication_system:
  trigger: "build user authentication"
  team: [security-auditor, backend-architect, frontend-developer, test-writer-fixer]
  coordination: security_first_then_implementation

performance_optimization:
  trigger: "optimize performance"
  team: [profiler-agent, performance-optimizer, database-tuner, load-tester]
  coordination: parallel_analysis_then_sequential_fixes
```

### Debugging & Investigation
```bash
# Natural language triggers generated for your specific project:
"debug this error" ‚Üí error-detective + test-writer-fixer + documentation-updater
"investigate slow queries" ‚Üí database-tuner + profiler-agent + performance-optimizer
"security audit this endpoint" ‚Üí security-auditor + penetration-tester + compliance-checker
"optimize bundle size" ‚Üí performance-optimizer + webpack-specialist + asset-optimizer
```

# ‚Üí Complete project intelligence in structured format

# Generate agent-specific environments
claude-builder ./project generate agents --template=web-api
# ‚Üí Specialized agent configuration for API development
```

### Git Integration & Safety
```bash
# Safe git integration (recommended - files not committed)
claude-builder ./project --git-exclude

# Control references in generated content
claude-builder ./project --claude-mentions=forbidden   # No AI references
claude-builder ./project --claude-mentions=minimal     # Minimal technical references
claude-builder ./project --claude-mentions=allowed     # Full attribution

# Backup existing files before generation
claude-builder ./project --backup-existing
```

### Template & Configuration Management
```bash
# List available built-in templates
claude-builder templates list
# ‚Üí Shows base, language-specific, and framework templates

# Validate custom template structure
claude-builder templates validate ./custom-template

# Initialize and manage project configuration
claude-builder config init ./project
claude-builder config show ./project
```

### Future Natural Language Interaction (Vision)
```bash
# Coming with Agent Orchestration Engine:
claude-builder ./project orchestrate "build user authentication system"
claude-builder ./project ask "how do I optimize this database query?"
claude-builder ./project deploy "with security audit and performance testing"
```
