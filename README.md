> **Analyzes your project and generates tailored Claude Code development environments
> with intelligent agent selection and project-specific guidance.**

## What Claude Builder Does

**Currently:** Analyzes projects (15+ languages, 25+ frameworks) and generates
intelligent `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files with project-specific agent
recommendations.

**In Development:** Working toward natural language triggers like "optimize this
API" that automatically suggest relevant agent teams based on your project
context.

**Goal:** Reduce the overhead of discovering and coordinating Claude Code
agents by providing smart defaults and context-aware suggestions.

---

## Key Features

### üîç **Project Analysis**

Detects languages, frameworks, project types, and complexity to understand your codebase

```bash
# Analyzes project characteristics
Project: Python FastAPI + PostgreSQL
Detection: Web API, moderate complexity
Suggests: backend-architect, api-tester, database-optimizer
```

### ü§ñ **Agent Recommendations**

Suggests relevant Claude Code agents based on your project's characteristics

```bash
# For a React dashboard project
Recommended agents: frontend-developer, ui-designer, performance-optimizer
Generated triggers: "optimize bundle size", "improve accessibility", "design components"
```

### üìù **Documentation Generation**

Creates tailored `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files with project-specific guidance

```bash
claude-builder /your/project
# Generates CLAUDE.md with development guidelines
# Creates AGENTS.md with suggested agent teams
# Includes project-specific best practices
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Template System**

Uses hierarchical templates (base + language + framework) for consistent,
relevant output

```bash
# Template composition example
base.md ‚Üí python.md ‚Üí fastapi.md ‚Üí final output
# Results in FastAPI-specific development guidance
```

---

## üéØ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** (Ready to use today)

#### Project Analysis (good coverage for common stacks)

- **15+ Languages**: Python, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#,
  Ruby, and more
- **25+ Frameworks**: Django, FastAPI, React, Vue, Axum, Spring Boot, Express,
  Next.js, Laravel
- **Architecture Patterns**: MVC, microservices, domain-driven design,
  serverless detection
- **Intelligence Engine**: Dependency analysis, file pattern recognition,
  confidence scoring

#### CLI with Rich UI

```bash
# Comprehensive command structure
claude-builder /path/to/project                          # Full environment generation
claude-builder /path/to/project --dry-run --verbose      # Safe preview mode
claude-builder /path/to/project generate agents          # Agent-specific generation
claude-builder /path/to/project analyze --output=json   # Export project analysis
```

#### Template System with Hierarchical Composition

- **Base + Language + Framework** intelligent overlay system
- **Variable Substitution Engine** with project-specific context
- **Professional Documentation** with working examples and guidance

### DevOps & MLOps (Honest Scope)

We are expanding beyond language/framework analysis to include DevOps, MLOps,
and IaC. Today, claude_builder detects Dockerfiles and docker-compose (and
basic Kubernetes directory hints). We are actively adding detection and
guidance for:

- IaC: Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation/SAM, Ansible (roles/playbooks),
  Puppet/Chef/Salt, Packer
- Orchestration: Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, Nomad
- CI/CD: Common pipeline configs (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins,
  CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket Pipelines)
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
 - MLOps: DVC, MLflow, Airflow, Prefect, dbt, Great Expectations,
   Kubeflow, Feast, Kedro (initial detection only; confidence varies)

What this means right now:

- Guidance-focused: We generate agent recommendations and documentation
  (INFRA/DEPLOYMENT/OBSERVABILITY/MLOPS) without changing your infrastructure.
- Honest limits: Detection accuracy varies by stack; coverage is growing.
  Secrets are never parsed; we only detect presence of files/configs.

Quick examples (expected agent suggestions):

```bash
# Terraform module repo
Recommended: terraform-specialist, ci-pipeline-engineer, security-auditor

# Helm + K8s manifests
Recommended: kubernetes-operator, helm-specialist, observability-engineer
```

#### Agent System Foundation

- **40+ Specialized Agents** with intelligent project-based selection
- **Team Composition Logic** for optimal agent combinations
- **Git Integration** with agent environment versioning

### üîß **IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

#### Natural Language Trigger Generation

## Real-World Examples

### Python FastAPI Project

**Manual approach:** Research agents, create generic configurations, remember
which agents work well together

**With claude-builder:**

```bash
claude-builder ./my-fastapi-project
# Detects: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis
# Suggests: backend-architect, api-tester, database-optimizer, security-auditor
# Generates context: API development patterns, database optimization, security considerations
```

### React Dashboard Project

**Before:** Individual agent discovery, manual coordination overhead

```bash
# Traditional approach
- Look up frontend-specific agents
- Manually coordinate ui-designer with frontend-developer
- Remember which agents work well together for React projects
```

**After:** Seamless team orchestration with contextual intelligence

```bash
claude-builder ./react-dashboard
# Detects: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
# Team: frontend-developer, ui-designer, performance-optimizer, accessibility-checker
# Triggers: "optimize bundle size", "improve accessibility", "design better UX"
```

### Rust CLI Tool

**Before:** Generic guidance, no systems-specific optimization

```bash
# Traditional approach
- Use general-purpose agents not optimized for systems programming
- Miss Rust-specific performance and memory management expertise
- No integration with Rust ecosystem tools and patterns
```

**After:** Systems programming expertise with Rust specialization

```bash
claude-builder ./rust-cli-tool
# Detects: Rust, CLI patterns, system dependencies, performance requirements
# Team: systems-programmer, performance-optimizer, cli-specialist, rust-expert
# Triggers: "optimize memory usage", "improve CLI ergonomics", "add benchmarks"
```
