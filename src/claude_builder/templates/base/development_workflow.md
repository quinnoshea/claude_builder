# ${project_name} - Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow and best practices for ${project_name}.

**Project Type**: ${project_type}
**Primary Language**: ${primary_language}
**Generated**: ${timestamp}

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes

### Commit Standards

- Use conventional commit messages
- Include ticket/issue references
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Squash commits before merging

### Example Commit Messages

```
feat(${primary_component}): add user authentication system
fix(${primary_component}): resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: update API documentation for v2.0
test: add integration tests for payment flow
```

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass and coverage requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated

### Review Guidelines

- Review for logic, not just syntax
- Suggest improvements and alternatives
- Ensure code is maintainable and readable
- Verify test coverage and quality

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

1. **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated component tests
2. **Integration Tests (20%)**: Component interaction tests
3. **E2E Tests (10%)**: Full user workflow tests

### Test Organization

```
${test_structure}
```

### Running Tests

```bash

# Run all tests

${test_run_command}

# Run with coverage

${coverage_command}

# Run specific test suite

${specific_test_command}
```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks

- Linting and code formatting
- Static analysis and security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Performance regression testing

### Quality Gates

- All CI checks must pass
- Code review approval required
- No critical security issues
- Performance benchmarks met

### Tools and Commands

```bash

# Code formatting

${format_command}

# Linting

${lint_command}

# Security scan

${security_scan_command}

# Performance test

${performance_test_command}
```

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

1. Merge to develop branch
2. Automated staging deployment
3. Run staging test suite
4. Manual QA verification

### Production Deployment

1. Create release branch from develop
2. Final testing and validation
3. Merge to main with tag
4. Automated production deployment
5. Post-deployment monitoring

### Deployment Commands

```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

- Application health endpoints
- Database connection status
- External service dependencies
- Performance metrics

### Logging and Observability

- Structured logging with appropriate levels
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring and APM
- Business metrics and analytics

### Maintenance Tasks

- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Performance optimization
- Database maintenance
