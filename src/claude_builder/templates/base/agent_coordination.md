## Overview
This document defines the agent coordination patterns and workflows for ${project_name} development.

**Project Type**: ${project_type}
**Primary Language**: ${primary_language}
**Generated**: ${timestamp}

## Agent Architecture

### Primary Development Team
${development_agents}

### Specialized Agents
${specialized_agents}

### Agent Coordination Patterns
${coordination_patterns}

## Workflow Orchestration

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**
   - **studio-coach**: Project planning and task breakdown
   - **rapid-prototyper**: Initial architecture and design
   
2. **Implementation Phase**
   - **${primary_development_agent}**: Core feature implementation
   - **test-writer-fixer**: Test development and validation
   
3. **Quality Assurance Phase**
   - **performance-benchmarker**: Performance testing and optimization
   - **security-specialist**: Security review and vulnerability assessment
   
4. **Deployment Phase**
   - **devops-automator**: Deployment automation and monitoring
   - **infrastructure-maintainer**: Production environment management

### Agent Handoff Protocols

#### Code Implementation → Testing
```
${primary_development_agent} completes feature
  ↓
test-writer-fixer creates comprehensive tests
  ↓  
performance-benchmarker validates performance
  ↓
security-specialist reviews security implications
```

#### Testing → Deployment
```
All tests pass and quality gates met
  ↓
devops-automator handles deployment
  ↓
infrastructure-maintainer monitors production
  ↓
analytics-reporter tracks performance metrics
```

## Agent-Specific Guidelines

### Development Agents
${development_agent_guidelines}

### Testing Agents
- **test-writer-fixer**: Focus on comprehensive coverage and edge cases
- **api-tester**: Validate API contracts and integration points
- **performance-benchmarker**: Ensure performance requirements are met

### Operations Agents
- **devops-automator**: Automate deployment and CI/CD processes
- **infrastructure-maintainer**: Monitor and maintain production systems
- **analytics-reporter**: Track business and technical metrics

## Communication Protocols

### Agent Information Sharing
- Use standardized data formats for agent handoffs
- Maintain shared context through documentation updates
- Ensure traceability of decisions and implementations

### Coordination Patterns
${coordination_communication}

### Escalation Procedures
- Complex issues require **studio-coach** coordination
- Performance issues escalate to **performance-benchmarker**
- Security concerns escalate to **security-specialist**
- Deployment issues escalate to **devops-automator**

## Quality Gates and Checkpoints

### Development Checkpoints
1. **Feature Complete**: Core functionality implemented
2. **Tests Written**: Comprehensive test coverage achieved
3. **Performance Validated**: Performance requirements met
4. **Security Reviewed**: Security considerations addressed
5. **Documentation Updated**: All documentation current
